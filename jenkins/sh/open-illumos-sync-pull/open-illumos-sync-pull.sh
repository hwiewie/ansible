# We need to specify a few specific options to "ssh" when "git push" is
# used below, so we use the GIT_SSH environment variable to do this.
#
# We don't use the user's "~/.ssh/config" directory to do this, as that
# isn't a directory that is unique to this specific build; thus,
# failures could be introduced as a result of this shared directory
# being modified by some external process. Using GIT_SSH isolates the
# dependencies of this job to resources that are controlled and managed
# by Jenkins.
#
# Additionally, even though we're specifying the HOME environment
# variable to point to PWD, this variable isn't honored by the "ssh"
# command. Thus, it wasn't as simple as generating a ".ssh" directory
# with the proper "config" file in the current directory, hoping it
# would be used by "ssh" due to the setting of HOME.

# environment variable, which is why we use this variable when creating
# the private key file. Since we've modified the HOME variable above,
# tnis isolates this configuration to only affecting this build, as
# opposed to modifying the user's actual home directory which could
# affect processes outside of this build.
